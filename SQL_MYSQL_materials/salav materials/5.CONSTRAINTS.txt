*INTEGRITY CONSTRAINS:
Constrains are rules which are applied on tables.
Constrains helps in improving the accurency and quality of the data base.
They are five types of constrains.

1. NOT NULL
2. UNIQUE
3. PRIMARY KEY
4. FOREIGN KEY or REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY CONSTRAINS
5. CHECK

Constrains can be created at two levels

a. Column level
b. Table level

1.NOT NULL: This constrains will not accept null values.
NOT NULL constrains can be created only at column level.
Ex:
*Create table student1(Sno number(3) NOT NULL,
Sname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3));

2.UNIQUE CONSTRAINS: This constrains will not accept duplicate values.
This constrains can be created at column level as well as table level.
Ex: Creating unique constraint at column level.
* Create table student3(Sno number(3) UNIQUE,
Sname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3));


*Create table student4(Sno number(3) UNIQUE,
Sname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3) UNIQUE);
Insert into student4 values(101,’Arun’,50);
Insert into student4 values(102,’Arun’,50);

Creating unique constraint at table level:

* Create table student5(Sno number(3),
Sname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3),
UNIQUE(Sno));


Note: There is no different when a constrain at column level or table level.


**3. PRIMARY KEY CONSTRIANS:
A primary key constrains of a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
A primary key constrains will not accept null values as well as duplicate values.
Primary key column is used to uniquely every row in a table.
A table can have only one primary key.
Primary key constrains can be created at column level or table level.
Create primary key constraint at column level:
Ex:
* Create table student6(Sno number(3) PRIMARY KEY,
Sname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3));

Create Primary key constraint at table level:
Ex:
* Create table student7(Sno number(3),
Sname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3)
PRIMARY KEY(Sno));

***3.1.COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY:
When primary key is applied a multiple columns it is called composite primary key.
Composite primary key can be applied only at table level.

*Creating composite primary key constraint at table level:
Ex:
Create table student9(Surname varchar2(10),
Firstname varchar2(10),
Marks number(3),
PRIMARY KEY(Surname,Firstname));

***4.FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINS or REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY:
These constraints establish relationship between tables.
This relationship is called as parent and child relationship. It is also called master detail relationship.

A foreign key column in the child table will only accept values which are their the primary key column or unique column of parent table.

*Check constraint: 

CREATE TABLE Persons ( ID int NOT NULL, 
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, 
FirstName varchar(255),
 Age int,
 CHECK (Age>=18));

Here you can observe that we are defining Check constraint for one field. T
his will help us if anyone is entering the data, then that field will check if that data meets the requirement.

 For example: - If you are seeing some sites or any applications, it will ask you like enter your age. 
 In age column if you enter 13 or 14, application will not allow you to move further as you are not meeting the requirement. 
 The requirement is that your age should be 18 or above. 
 Like this we can give any Check constraint to any fields or multiple fields in the table.
