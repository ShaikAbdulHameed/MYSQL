Sub Queries :
===================================

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS1(
   CUSTOMER_ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   PRIMARY KEY (CUSTOMER_ID)
);
---------------------------------------------

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS1 (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 );

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS1 (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 );

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS1 (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (3, 'kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 );

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS1 (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (4, 'Chaitali', 25, 'Mumbai', 6500.00 );

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS1 (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (5, 'Hardik', 27, 'Bhopal', 8500.00 );

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS1 (CUSTOMER_ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (6, 'Komal', 22, 'MP', 4500.00 );
===============================

Note:
Subqueries should always place in the inside.
Subqueries are executed first and then parent query is executed by using the result of sub query.


1. Single Row subquery :  When subquery returns one row (1 value). It is called Single RowSubquery

Single Row Subquery:
When subquery returns one row (1 value). It is called Single RowSubquery


Select * from customers1 where salary > (select salary from customers1 where name = 'Khilan');

Select * from customers1 where salary > (select salary from customers1
Where name = (select name from customers1
Where customer_id = 4));


2. Multiple Row subquery
When subquery returns multiple rows. It is called multiple row Subquery.
Note: we should multiple row operators with multiple row subqueries. They are three multiple row operators.
1. IN
2. ANY
3. ALL

Select * from customers1
Where salary > ALL(Select salary from customers1
Where customer_id = 1);

3. Multiple column subquery

When subquery return more then one column. It is called multiple column subquery.
We should use in operator with multiple column subqueries.

Select * from customers1 where(address,salary) IN
(select address, salary from customers1 where customer_id = 1);

4. Co-related subquery

When subquery is executed in relation to parent query, it is called co-related subquery.

Select * from customers1 where salary > (select AVG(salary) from customers1 
where customer_id =4)
