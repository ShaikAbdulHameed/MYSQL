Unix Basic Commands: -

Files:

Touch-- To create the file ex : touch filename
• ls --- lists your files
 ls-l --- lists your files in 'long format', which contains lots of useful information,
 e.g. the exact size of the file, who owns the file and who has the right to look at it, 
 and when it was last modified. 
 ls -a --- lists all files, including the ones whose filenames begin in a dot, 
 ls-ltr--shows the recent files at the last

• more filename --- shows the first part of a file, just as much as will fit on one screen. 
Just hit the space bar to see more or q to quit. 
 Grep: is used to search the file patterns
CAT filename : display the content of the file as will fit on one screen

• Vi filename --- is an editor that lets you  edit a file. 
save the changes !wq, dont save the changes !Q

• mv filename1 filename2 --- moves a file (i.e. gives it a different name,
 or moves it into a different directory (see below)
 
• cp filename1 filename2 --- copies a file

• rm filename --- removes a file. It is wise to use the option 
rm -i, which will ask you for confirmation before deleting anything. 

• diff filename1 filename2 --- compares files, and shows where they differ

• wc filename --- tells you how many lines, words, and characters there are in a file
wc-l filename : to display the record count in the file 

-->Wildcard Characters : 
-->% : is used to get the all the characters in the string  (H%)
-->? : is used to get the single character in the string (R?M)

-->head: is used to get the fist records in the file : head-5 filename
-->Tail : is used to get the last records in the file : Tail-5 filename
-->get the records in the file 25to30 in a file 
head-30 filename||tail-5 filename
• chmod options filename --- lets you change the read, write, and execute permissions on your files. 
The default is that only you can look at them and change them, but you may sometimes want to change these permissions.
 chmod777
 
 ==================================
 SED Commands : Stream editor
 Replacing or substituting string : Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. 
 The below simple sed command replaces the word “unix” with “linux” in the file.
-->sed 's/unix/linux/' filename.txt

Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line : Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, 
second occurrence of a pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word 
“unix” with “linux” in a line.
sed 's/unix/linux/2' filename.txt

Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line : The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies 
the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.
sed 's/unix/linux/g' filename.txt

Replacing from nth occurrence to all occurrences in a line : Use the combination of /1, /2 etc and /g 
to replace all the patterns from the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line. 
The following sed command replaces the third, fourth, fifth… “unix” word with “linux” word in a line.
sed 's/unix/linux/3g' filename.txt

Parenthesize first character of each word : This sed example prints the first character of every word in parenthesis.
 echo "Welcome To The Geek Stuff" | sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\(\1\)/g'
Output:
(W)elcome (T)o (T)he (G)eek (S)tuff

Replacing string on a specific line number : You can restrict the sed command to replace the string on a specific
 line number. An example is
sed '3 s/unix/linux/' filename.txt

Printing only the replaced lines : Use the -n option along with the /p print flag to display only the replaced lines.
 Here the -n option suppresses the duplicate rows generated by the /p flag and prints the replaced lines only one time.
sed -n 's/unix/linux/p' geekfile.txt

Replacing string on a range of lines : You can specify a range of line numbers
 to the sed command for replacing a string.
sed '1,3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt

Deleting lines from a particular file : SED command can also be used for deleting lines from a particular file. 
SED command is used for performing deletion operation without even opening the file
Examples:
1. To Delete a particular line say n in this example
Syntax:
 sed 'nd' filename.txt
Example:
 sed '5d' filename.txt
2. To Delete a last line

Syntax:
 sed '$d' filename.txt
3. To Delete line from range x to y

Syntax:
 sed 'x,yd' filename.txt
Example:
 sed '3,6d' filename.txt
4. To Delete from nth to last line

Syntax:
 sed 'nth,$d' filename.txt
Example:
 sed '12,$d' filename.txt
5.To Delete pattern matching line

Syntax:
 sed '/pattern/d' filename.txt
Example:
 sed '/abc/d' filename.txt


• File Compression
o gzip filename --- compresses files, so that they take up much less space.
 Usually text files compress to about half their original size, 
 G zip produces files with the ending '.gz' appended to the original filename.
o gunzip filename --- uncompresses files compressed by gzip.
o gzcat filename --- lets you look at a gzipped file without actually having to gunzip it (same as gunzip -c). 
You can even print it directly, using gzcat filename  
============================================
Directories: -

Directories, like folders on a Macintosh, are used to group files together in a hierarchical structure.

• mkdir dirname --- make a new directory
• cd dirname --- change directory. You basically 'go' to another directory, 
and you will see the files in that directory when you do 'ls'. 
You always start out in your 'home directory', 
and you can get back there by typing 'cd' without arguments. 
'cd ..' will get you one level up from your current position. 
CD/ : You don't have to walk along step by step - you can make big leaps or avoid walking around by specifying.
• pwd(Present Working directory) --- tells you where you currently are

• who --- tells you who's logged on(Username)
• finger username --- gives you lots of information about that user, 
e.g. when they last read their mail and whether they're logged in. 

• last -1 username --- tells you when the user last logged on and off and from where. 
Without any options, last will give you a list of everyone's logins.

• write username --- lets you exchange one-line messages with another user
• elm --- lets you send e-mail messages to people around the world (
